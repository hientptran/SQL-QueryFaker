# SQL-QueryFaker

Simple command line program to generate fake data for SQL insert queries using the JavaFaker library. Created for my Database course because I'm sick of manually creating excel tables.

_P/s: This is just a simple script I made for my own convenience and is in no way bug-free :-)_

## Installation
Run the JAR file from your command prompt/terminal with `java -jar SQLQueryFaker-1.0.jar`

## Future features
I'm currently working on these features:
  - Export data to csv file
  - Export SQL queries to txt file
