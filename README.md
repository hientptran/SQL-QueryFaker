# SQL-QueryFaker

Simple command line program to generate fake data for SQL insert queries using the [JavaFaker](https://github.com/DiUS/java-faker) library. Created for my Database course because I'm sick of manually creating excel tables.

Current supported features include:
- Generate SQL (PostgresSQL) queries with fake data
- Export generated queries to .txt file

P/s: This is just a simple script I made for my own convenience and is in no way bug-free :-)_

## Installation
Run the JAR file from your command prompt/terminal with `java -jar SQLQueryFaker-1.0.jar`

## Future features
I'm currently working on these features:
  - Export data to csv file
